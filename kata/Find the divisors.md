Create a function named divisors/Divisors that takes an integer and returns an array with all of the integer's divisors(except for 1 and the number itself). If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result<Vec<u32>, String> in Rust).

Example:
```
divisors(12); // should return [2,3,4,6]
divisors(25); // should return [5]
divisors(13); // should return "13 is prime"
```
You can assume that you will only get positive integers as inputs.
