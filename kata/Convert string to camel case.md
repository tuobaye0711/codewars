Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized.

Examples:

```javascript
// returns "theStealthWarrior"
toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior") 

// returns "TheStealthWarrior"
toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior")
```
