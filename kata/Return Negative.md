In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

    makeNegative(1); // return -1
    makeNegative(-5); // return -5
    makeNegative(0); // return 0

Notes:

- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) can't be negative, see examples above.
